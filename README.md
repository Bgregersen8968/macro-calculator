# **macro-calculator**
 This calculator will give you specific macro nutrirents based on your body weight goals.
 I really enjoyed writting this code because it combines two things that I like to do with my spare time. learning and physical fitness.
 The program is quite simple to run, there is a series of promps displayed that will gather basic information such as age, height, weight and current body weight goal. 
 Once the information is entered, the consol will display your total daily calories and macro nutrients needed to achieve set goal. 
 Below that an hourly break down will be displayed of how many meals should be eaten in a day and wich macro nutrients should be consumed during that eating period.
### Thank you for checking out my program!
